This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4254

Based on the standard syntax file for plsql.vim.

New features ( comparing to the standard plsql.vim, contained in Vim 7.3):

   1) Now you can use multilined literal strings. The string
'A
B
C
'   will be highlighted properly.


   1) folding feature for procedures and functions ( including internal procedures and functions)
for a simple example, the procedure "testProcedure" with comments will be folded: 

declare

  /*
    Test procedure;    
  */
  procedure testProcedure
  is
  begin
    null;
  end testProcedure;
  
begin
  testProcedure();
end;
